<h3>🚀 About Me</h3>
<p>
  I’m an engineering student with a strong interest in building 
  <strong>scalable, intelligent, and reliable systems</strong> that sit at the intersection of
  <strong>data, algorithms, and infrastructure</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  Throughout my academic and professional journey, I’ve worked on projects involving:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>📊 <strong>Data processing and visualization</strong> to support decision-making</li>
  <li>🧠 <strong>Machine learning models</strong> for real-world prediction tasks</li>
  <li>🖥️ <strong>Software systems</strong> with performance, robustness, and usability in mind</li>
</ul>

<p>
  I enjoy understanding not only <em>what</em> systems do, but also <em>how</em> they work end-to-end —
  from data acquisition and pipelines to models, deployment, and system constraints.
</p>
